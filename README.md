Okay so for sure I really struggled with the grid. I wasn't sure how to go about making it, but after a long day of research, I was able to gather the solution using flexbox and the calc function with css.

I had A BLAST decorating the page and whatnot. I really dig retro wave so this was a fun little thing to do. I hope you like it if you try it out! :)
